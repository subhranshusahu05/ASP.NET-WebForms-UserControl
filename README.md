The goal is to practice Web User Controls, C# CodeBehind, and partial page updates (AJAX using UpdatePanel).

üõ† Steps I Followed
1Ô∏è‚É£ Created a Web User Control (WebUserControl1.ascx)

I created a .ascx file that contains:

A TextBox to display the selected date.

An ImageButton with a calendar icon to toggle the Calendar visibility.

An ASP.NET Calendar that is initially hidden.

ScriptManager and UpdatePanel so that only the calendar part updates without refreshing the whole page.

üëâ This control can be reused anywhere in the project.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Wrote Backend Logic for User Control (WebUserControl1.ascx.cs)

Event imgDate_Click ‚Üí Toggles the Calendar visibility.

Event cldDate_SelectionChanged ‚Üí Updates the TextBox with the selected date and hides the calendar.

Event cldDate_VisibleMonthChanged ‚Üí Updates TextBox with the current visible month (example feature).

Clear() method ‚Üí Clears the TextBox, resets selected dates, and shows the current month again.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Created the Main Form (FinalOut.aspx)

Added Name, Email, Password input fields.

Registered and added the custom calendar control (UC1:usercalender) inside the form.

Added a Clear Button to reset the form.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Wrote Backend Logic for Main Form (FinalOut.aspx.cs)

When the Clear button is clicked:

Clears TextBox1 (Name), TextBox2 (Email), and TextBox3 (Password).

Calls the ucdate.Clear() method to reset the calendar user control.
